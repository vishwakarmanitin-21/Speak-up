.SYNOPSIS
    One-command release for SpeakUp: build -> GitHub release -> installed copy.

.DESCRIPTION
    Removes the risk of a half-done release. Runs every step that has to happen
    for "the app" to actually be updated everywhere, in order, and aborts loudly
    if any step fails:

      0. Bump the MINOR version in src\version.py  (skip with -NoBump)
      1. Run the test suite            (skip with -SkipTests)
      2. Rebuild the exe (PyInstaller) -> dist\SpeakUp.exe
      3. Commit + push the version bump so the release tag isn't stale
      4. Create the GitHub release for the new version and upload the exe
                                                   (skip with -NoRelease)
      5. Overwrite the installed copy you actually launch, closing the running
         app first and relaunching it if it was open (skip with -NoInstall)

    EVERY build gets its own version, so you can always tell which one is
    running (tray -> About) and whether a machine has the latest. The minor
    number keeps incrementing (1.1.0 -> 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0); -Major starts a new
    series (1.4.0 -> 2.0.0); -NoBump reuses the current version while iterating.
    src\version.py is the single source of truth for the app, exe and tag.

.EXAMPLE
    .\release.ps1
        Full release: tests, build, GitHub upload, update local copy.

.EXAMPLE
    .\release.ps1 -SkipTests -NoRelease
        Just rebuild and refresh the local installed copy (fast local iteration).
